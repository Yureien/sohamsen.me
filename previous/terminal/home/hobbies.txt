People have hobbies. I have them too, though a bit different from "normal" ones.
I'll definitely be writing in my <a href="https://blog.sohamsen.me/" target="_blank">blog</a> about these hobbies.

1. I love receiving and transmitting radio waves. Like listening to weather satellites transmitting a picture.
   Or creating my own LTE basestation.

2. Tinkering with electronics is yet another hobby of mine. Rather, this hobby gave birth to my radio hobby.

3. Did I say how much I love the deep space? My childhood wish was/is to become an astronaut.
   Sadly, I'm just a student and not old enough to specialize in astronomy, so I can only be an amateur now.
   Every now and then, I try to participate in astronomy competitions.

4. Oh, and I also own a 8" F/6 Dobsonian Telescope, I'll try to post some astropics too.
   Sadly, where I live,the light and air pollution is unforgiving :(

5. If the katakana version of my name was not enough, let me write it: I am a weeb/otaku/anime-lover.
   No, I don't own waifu dakimakuras. Yes I love anime/manga/VNs/LNs.
