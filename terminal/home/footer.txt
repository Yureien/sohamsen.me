Some features are still pending, such as:
1. Cycle through command log (which is preferably stored in localstorage?) with arrow keys.
2. Tab auto-completition.
3. More commands?
4. Maybe a text editor that stores to localstorage :D
5. Quick commands stop working after scrolling due to autofocus. Needs fix.
6. Word wrap needs fix too.
